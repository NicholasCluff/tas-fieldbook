-- NOTE: This file contains problematic policies with circular dependencies
-- The approach of having project owners manage permissions through RLS creates circular dependencies
-- 
-- RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: 
-- Handle permission management at the APPLICATION LEVEL instead of through RLS policies
-- 
-- The current simplified policies in fixed_project_permissions_rls_policy.sql only allow:
-- - Users to view/manage their own permission records
-- 
-- Project owners should manage permissions through application code that:
-- 1. Checks ownership directly in the projects table
-- 2. Then performs INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations on project_permissions
-- 3. Uses service-level security rather than RLS for these operations
--
-- This avoids circular dependencies while maintaining security through application logic.
